# BEGINNER-TO-INTERMIDIATE-TO-OPEN-CV
  OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It was built to provide a
common infrastructure for computer vision and to accelerate the use of machine perceptron. The aim of this little
build up project is to throw more light on the way image processing is done using open cv and the similarities it has
with CNNs and also gives a thought on how to implement both in common in future projects.
